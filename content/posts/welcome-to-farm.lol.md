## What's a "digital farm"

Digital farms are simply a meta extension of traditional farms and come in two varieties:

1. Farms utilized for subsistence or money
2. Farms utilized for fun (hobby farms)


Digital farms utilized **for subsistence or money** seek to extract value from what they cultivate and raise for themselves or to supply the market.  These are **for profit** farms,

Digital farms utilized **for fun** are simply hobby farms.  These farms are simply for the enjoyment producing information, but are not exactly expecting much in return for the most part.

Both farms end up making the majority of the world wide web spanning from paid or "freemium" web applications/sites to not for profit blogs.  Each one of these farms contributes to the expansion of the world wide web which is an infinitely expanding entity.
